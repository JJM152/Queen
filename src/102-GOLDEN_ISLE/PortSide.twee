:: Portside
The @@color:gold;'Portside District'@@ is the bustling hub of this settlement. From this location most of the amenities that the common \
pirate or freebooter could desire can be accessed. Of particular note are two major establishments, the @@color:gold;'Golden Goods'@@ general store \
and the @@color:gold;'Saucy Slattern'@@ brothel, that are right next to each other, conveniently so you suppose. Off in the distance you can see \
a large arch with a sign hanging over it that says simply @@color:gold;'The Bazzar'@@ - no wonder what is in there, and further along up the hill \
you can see a guard house that marks the check point into the more affluent @@color:gold;'High Hill District'@@
