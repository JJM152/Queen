The @@color:gold;'Saucy Slattern'@@ is the place to be if your a pirate in need of a good rut, or even a bad one. The quality of \
the whores at this establishment reflects the relative wealth (or lack thereof) of the patrons and it shows not only there, but \
in the furnishings and decor of the waiting area. Everything is plush, with rich velvets and dark wood, but also shabby and \
worn down. Still, despite what goes on here, the place is clean. The proprietor clearly cares about such appearances, as \
meager as they are.
