:: Cargo
The cargo hold of the Salty Mermaid is a dank and musty area shrounded in darkness. Rows and rows of crates and barrels line the floors with an odd assortment of plundered "goods" spilling from them. Most of it looks like garbage, but you never know what you'll find if you look long enough.
