:: HiddenCove
<<set _Quest = window.App.QuestEngine; >>\
This hidden cove is easily missed from the sea, being concealed between two massive sheer rock faces and a small atoll of overgrown trees. The path \
from the jungle leads to a small secluded beach, the waves lazily drifting against it's rocky shore. It's apparent that someone has made a camp \
here recently as you can still see the remains of a cooking fire with several fish bones strewn haphazardly near by.
