:: Abamond
The sole pier on Abamond is a megalith is referred to by the locals as the @@color:gold;'Lonely Pier'@@ - it is a structure of \
unknown origins that has been around for longer than anyone can possibly remember and hints at the previously 'occupied' nature \
of this now desolate island. From the sandy shale of this beach you can see a vast jungle ahead of you, denser than you could \
have possibly imagined, and to the north the beach stretches out along the coast to a stark rock face that looks to have been \
hewed out of stone by the force of the waves.
