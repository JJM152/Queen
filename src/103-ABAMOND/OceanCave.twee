:: OceanCave
These caves are set far enough back from the beach that even at the high tide they still do not completely flood. The air is damp and salty and other \
than the occasional rock or wall covered with lichen you don't see any signs of life. A brief exploration has led you to conclude that there are some \
deeper tunnels that you could explore, if you were so inclined.
