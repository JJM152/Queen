:: FarBeach
The northern beach of Abamond comes to an abrupt end at a large rock face that has been so beaten down by the crashing sea \
that you cannot find any purchase to climb. Despite that you do notice that there are some small openings, caves by the look of it, \
that dot the meridian between the sandy beach and the cliffs above. Off in the distance you can still see the massive @@color:gold;'Lonely Pier'@@.
