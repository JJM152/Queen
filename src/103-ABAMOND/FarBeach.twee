:: FarBeach
The northern beach of Abamond comes to an abrupt end at a large rock face that has been so beaten down by the crashing sea that you cannot find any purchase to climb. Despite that, you do notice that there are some small openings -- caves by the look of it -- that dot the meridian between the sandy beach and the cliffs above. Off in the distance you can still see the massive @@color:gold;'Lonely Pier'@@.
