:: TreasureRoom
After a long and arduous trek you've finally made your way into the deepest and most secure part of the ancient ruins. Obviously \
this chamber was of some importance to be so deeply recessed into the complex, but what impresses you most is the care that went \
into the architecture - it has a large clean marble floor (where did they get that from?) and several columns around the \
perimeter of the room reach skywards towards an arched dome.

Towards the back of the room you see a small opening, upon inspecting it, it appears to be a secret tunnel leading back to the surface.
