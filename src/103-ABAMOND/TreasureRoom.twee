:: TreasureRoom
After a long and arduous trek you've finally made your way into the deepest and most secure part of the ancient ruins. Obviously this chamber was of some importance to be so deeply recessed into the complex, but what impresses you most is the care that went into the architecture -- it has a large clean marble floor (where would they get that from?) and several columns around the perimeter of the room reach skywards towards an arched dome.

Towards the back of the room you see a small opening. Upon inspecting it, it appears to be a secret tunnel leading back to the surface.
