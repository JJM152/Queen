            "START" : "A placard in copperplate calligraphy decrees this as The Iris Gallery. The walls are adorned in shades of purple, with gilded silver embellishments accenting the space. The bright purple flowers the room is named for are growing in several planter boxes. The small stage here is framed by a proscenium painted with the image of the goddess Aphrodite. Facing the stage is a semicircle of stuffed armchairs providing comfortable viewing. An usher in a silver waistcoat, breeches, white gloves and a formal wig escorts you to your seat.\n\n"+
            "After the seating fills, the usher steps to the front and loudly announces the title of the performance - \"The Tale of Iphis, or, The Star Crossed Marriage of Ancient Greece.\"\n\n"+
            "As the curtain opens, there is a brief drama in which a couple in rags are quickly introduced. The wife, portrayed by a gorgeous woman with ample curves, a lightly freckled, pale complexion and flowing red hair, wears padding under her clothing to show she is pregnant. The husband, played by a flabby, bearded male actor, makes some ado about not being able to afford a dowry, and makes a firm demand that they are to kill the child if it isn't a boy. He then exits the stage. Immediately thereafter, a mature woman meant to be the goddess Isis arrives, and tells the wife not to fear, offering her protection over the wife and her child.\n\n"+
            "The actresses depart the stage, and the usher returns to explain that the child was indeed a girl named Iphis. She was raised to adulthood as a boy to conceal her gender, and later betrothed to the beautiful Ianthe. Their true love blossomed.\n\n"+
            "After a brief costume change, the redheaded actress returns to the stage, dressed in a toga, this time as Iphis. Her betrothed, Ianthe, is played by a much younger but equally enchanting girl, who arrives in a long, white dress. The nubile young bride-to-be has generous curves, beautifully braided chestnut hair and fetching olive skin. The two embrace, and their lips meet in a passionate kiss, each delving the other with eagerly entwining tongues.\n\n"+
            "Iphis begins to undress Ianthe, slipping the shoulders of her lover's dress down to expose a pair of lovely, pert breasts with perfect shapeliness. Cupping the girl's perky tit-flesh in a gentle grasp, Iphis kisses her way down Ianthe's chin and neck until she reaches the soft mounds in her hand, enveloping the girl's nipple with her mouth and then tracing it with her tongue. Ianthe's nipples stiffen in response, growing firm and erect as the audience around you watches with growing lust.\n\n"+
            "Iphis slips her lover's dress down a little further, slowly letting the fabric descend over her betrothed's firm abdomen until it reaches her waistline. The woman slides a finger down Ianthe's center, slipping her hand into the half-fallen dress. There, her concealed hand begins to gingerly stroke the girl's pussy beneath the white fabric, eliciting a throaty gasp from the younger beauty.\n\n"+
            "With a wink to the audience, Iphis tilts her forearm downward, prying the girl's dress completely over the swell of her hips. The garment drops to Ianthe's ankles, revealing her delectable, naked body entirely. Iphis slips off her toga, too, leaving both of them naked as their bodies press softly together.\n\n"+
            "With the young beauty exposed to the gallery, Iphis' fingers part the plush folds of her lover's mons. She slowly immerses two slender digits fully inside the girl's puss, making the girl's mouth gape with the onset of intense pleasure. Iphis' hand begins to circle between the haplessly submissive girl's thighs, thrusting her fingers lightly inside and using a thumb to attend to Ianthe's petite, engorged clit.\n\n"+
            "Soon Ianthe is breathing hard, and the girl's sultry moans fill the gallery, along with hints of her aroused, feminine scent. Iphis lowers her lover's trembling body to the stage, shifting the girl's graceful thigh so that her sex is fully exposed to the audience. Leaning downward, Iphis cranes her head between the girl's parted legs and begins to taste her in earnest. Iphis' hand then snakes between her own legs, which part enough to provide the crowd with a a second view, and she sees to herself with the same vigorous jilling she gave her partner.\n\n"+
            "At the ministrations of the redhead's expert licking, Ianthe begins to writhe in time as her pussy is devoured. Iphis' tongue splits the girl's yielding crevasse, plunging into the slickened tunnel with a stiffened push, then withdraws to lap at her outer parts with obvious relish. The brunette's cries become deeper and louder, her hips bucking involuntarily, when suddenly a deep groan erupts from her mouth and her legs begin to shake rapidly as she cums.\n\n"+
            "Her orgasm lasts for tens of seconds, returning with several aftershocks as her lover applies deft, sparing touches to Ianthe's glistening girlhood. Almost simultaneously, Iphis is overcome with moans of her own as her self-loving fingers coax herself over the edge. The pair is transformed into an unbridled tangle of legs and quaking bodies, and the strong smell of sex affirms their climax was real.\n\n"+
            "As the waves finally diminish, the two women unsteadily clamber to their feet. Breathing hard, they bow to the audience as the delighted, bawdy crowd applauds and whistles, with one unruly gentleman offering to help the ladies with an encore. The stage curtains fall before things grow out of hand, and the usher invites the crowd to enjoy the remainder of their stay, perhaps in another gallery.\n\n",

Porcelain pots rest in each corner, full of the royal blue flowers that are the room's namesake. The small stage here is edged with a floral theme, with stylized curls of flowered stalks cast in painted relief, and an arc of stuffed armchairs faces its curtains. An usher in a silver waistcoat, breeches, white gloves and a formal wig escorts you to your seat.\n\n"+
            "As the audience finishes shuffling in, the usher steps forward to the foot of the stage. He announces the title of the forthcoming show - \"The Vain Suitor, or, The Parable of Misfortune Visited Upon an Ill Mannered Wooer.\"\n\n"+
            "As the curtain opens, a narrator dressed smartly in an azure coat, waistcoat and cravat with a long, curly brown wig strides to the apron of the stage. He takes up his position and posture with some minor ado before beginning to speak:\n\n"+
            "\"There once was a suitor most vain\nWhose manners aroused great disdain\nLike a fiend sent by Hades\nHe accosted fine ladies\nHis lusty intentions quite plain\"\n\n"+
            "As the narrator recites each line, a rakish man dressed in over-the-top finery crosses to center stage, strutting around like a peacock. An ensemble of actresses in long dresses pass to and fro across the stage, with the man pantomiming insincere courtship. Following his act, he brashly pulls at each lady's clothing to reveal naked breasts, butts and pussies with wicked delight, thrusting his groin at each of them as he fist pumps the air with abandon. His victims react in dramatic, mock surprise as they tease the audience with all-too-short views of their intimate places before running away backstage. The audience laughs appreciatively.\n\n"+
            "\"As the devious knave prowled the square\nRendering many poor lady bits bare\nHe came 'cross a lass\nWho accepted his pass\nAnd happily invited his stare\"\n\n"+
            "The stage around the rake clears. After a notable pause, a captivating, gorgeous woman in a silver-gilt gown saunters into view, fanning herself coquettishly. As she passes the unrepentant suitor, he telegraphs his naughty intentions to the audience with a gregarious hip-shaking dance and a wild eyed grin that gets the crowd roaring with laughter.\n\n"+
            "However, when he flips down the woman's broad neckline, causing her generous handfuls of breast to bounce into view, she reacts with a smile just as devious as his. To the audience's delight, she takes it a step further, cupping her tits with both hands and waving them enticingly to the cheers of the crowd. The man claps his hand in front of his mouth and his eyes fly open in exaggerated shock.\n\n"+
            "\"Could it be that our rake met his match?\nHe could seldom believe such a catch\nHe bent on his knee\nProposing with glee\nAnd sent forth his engagement dispatch\"\n\n"+
            "The suitor acts out the words of the poem, kneeling down and kissing the gowned lady's hand with apparent sincerity as he appears to propose marriage to her. He then proceeds to kiss slowly up her arm, pausing at her elbow, then waggles his eyebrows at the audience and kisses his way across her still exposed boobs. The woman responds by waggling her eyebrows at the audience, too, raising another round of uproarious laughter.\n\n"+
            "\"The wedding bells rang for the pair\nCementing their bawdy affair\nCome wedding night\nWith candles alight\nThe bride schemed to trigger her snare\"\n\n"+
            "Stoking the further amusement of the audience, the rake and his match suddenly tear off the outer layers of their clothing and throw them into the air, revealing wedding clothes underneath. A vicar absurdly jumps out from stage right, landing next to the couple in one hop, and conducts a 'ceremony' consisting of a few seconds' miming. As soon as they're done, the vicar jumps back offstage to another round of big laughs. Then, the groom and bride make a wide circle around the stage before pretending to open and enter the invisible door of their 'marital home.'\n\n"+
            "The couple are soon stripping down to their underthings, with the bride receiving the ardent aid of her groom. He's soon down to his 'birthday suit' and she to her long, white chemise. With the bride's back to the audience, he lifts the skirt of her undergown, and does a take with a surprised look and a silly hop when he looks underneath. A beat later, he repeats the take identically, drawing a flurry of giggles from the audience. His comedic timing is perfect, aided by the fact he is totally naked, and by his fourth repetition, the audience is nearly crying with laughter.\n\n"+
            "Suddenly, the bride turns around, holding up her hem for the audience to see what she's hiding. Her shapely legs are decidedly all woman, but she's packing a huge, thick she-cock that would put most others to shame. With a practiced maneuver, she whips her chemise over her head to reveal her (otherwise) flawless, sensuously feminine body, which only highlights just how big her package really is. A patter of uncertain chuckles and wanton surprise to either side of you signals the reveal had the desired effect on the patrons.\n\n"+
            "\"The tables quite turned on the groom\nHis eyes saw his forthcoming doom\nThe rake was mistaken\nWhose virginity'd be taken\nAnd learned he should not have assumed\"\n\n"+
            "The bride comically tilts her groom to the floor, putting him on all fours with a splat of his palms. She kneels behind him, turns to the audience nonchalantly, and then smacks his butt with a crisp swat. He responds with a silly yelp, and the crowd laughs it up. She raises her hand again, pausing for effect, then motions to ask the audience for approval to do it again. Naturally, the room is filled with assent, and the bride warms the groom's rear with a measured series of sassy spankings. Slowly speeding up, she transitions her slaps into a full fledged, two handed drum fill that gets people rolling.\n\n"+
            "Afterward, the bride pauses again, looking down at her big member, which now drapes over the crest of his ass. Looking back to the audience with an air of conspiracy, the bride's face slowly breaks into a wicked smile. Raising one eye, she tilts her head, silently asking the crowd if they want her to do what she's obviously planning. The room goes abuzz with murmurs for a moment, then someone shouts, \"give it to him!\" and supportive cheering breaks out.\n\n"+
            "The bride takes her big cock in hand and slowly tilts it to the groom's rear. She shifts her hips back in an out-sized motion, as if she's going to really ram her dick home, when the groom suddenly turns his shoulders to her and holds up a finger. She freezes, looking at the crowd in puzzlement as the groom whistles loudly toward backstage. At this, the vicar jumps out again, hands some kind of lubricant to the bride, and then jumps back out of sight. The room explodes with laughter, and the bride takes the moment to douse all key body parts involved with generous lubing.\n\n"+
            "Finally, she pushes the tip of her fat stick into the rake's back hole. At first, he makes a face as if he's going to scream in agony, but just as he starts to cry out, he cuts himself short mid-yell, ponders for a moment, and then shrugs toward the audience with a \"hrm, not so bad\" look. She slides her cock in the rest of the way, and he responds with a big, saucy chortle that simply kills it with the crowd. Soon, the couple is fucking in earnest, and he shoots one last over-the-top facial expression at the audience, showing his ridiculous pleasure at bottoming for his bride. The curtain closes to a final round of applause.\n\n"+

            "\"In the annals of Rome we lay our tale, of Venus, goddess of love, sex, fertility and beauty. It was in these ancient days that the gods visited the mortal world and joined in their affairs.\"\n\n"+
            "The curtain draws back, exposing a stage which has been set with a large mattress and silky, crimson sheets. Upon them reclines a classically beautiful, soft figured woman portraying Venus. Her body is completely nude except for her glittering earrings and a golden bracelet around her wrist. Her flaxen hair is styled in a resplendent crown braid, and she holds a small bouquet of roses in her hand. Her light skin complements her supple curves, apple-sized breasts, and long, curvaceous legs.\n\n"+
            "\"It was in the mortal realm,\" the narrator continues, \"where Venus first found Adonis, then an orphaned infant. Venus delivered him to Proserpina, Queen of the Underworld, to raise and protect. As the boy matured into manhood, it is said he became the peerless ideal of masculine beauty. At length, upon seeing him for the first time as a grown man, Venus fell deeply in love at once.\"\n\n"+
            "A naked man with a finely toned body, bronzed skin and exceptionally handsome features enters the stage. He enters with an air of undefinable presence and charisma, and it's clear his is the part of Adonis. Venus reaches up a hand to him, and he approaches and kneels beside her.\n\n"+
            "Venus draws him close to her, and she begins to caress his chest. In return, Adonis leans closer, kissing her, and her eyes take on a dreamy look as he graces her with languid attention. He gives her the touch of his fingertips on her arms and of his lips on her cheek and neck, and her responsive movement reveals her enthrallment.\n\n"+
            "He lies down behind her. His upper arm enfolds Venus' torso, easing her back into his muscular chest. She nestles her body into his, enjoying his touch as he begins to explore her curved form.\n\n"+
            "As he kisses the alluring goddess, his hand strokes lightly down the valley of her waist and up the apex of her hip. It continues into the crease of Venus' upper leg and over her smooth belly, until reaching the base of her comely boobs. Her hand meets his and she urges him further, draping her fingers over his and guiding him to enclose her breast. Her large, pink areola peeks between his thumb and forefinger as he clasps her soft mound and gently strokes it.\n\n"+
            "Venus shifts her arm down her own body, parting her legs to receive her hand on her cleft. She wraps her leg back over Adonis', at once adding space between her thighs and increasing the physical connection between them. With a pair of fingertips, the goddess finds her hood and begins to circle the sensitive nub it shrouds. She lets out a quiet whimper of pleasure as the stimulation builds, and her hips begin to rock against his.\n\n"+
            "Sensing she is ready for him, Adonis reaches down and lifts Venus' knee, supporting her leg. Upon spreading her, his sizable cock springs forward into intimate contact with her already parted lower lips. Her wetness is palpable, and he slips into her without resistance. She gasps as he enters her, shifting herself to take him deeply inside. They merge with each other in a steady rhythm, moaning in rapture.\n\n"+
            "At that moment, a second woman enters the stage. She is raven haired and fair skinned, her nudity leaving nothing about her bewitching figure to the imagination. Her winsome curves include generous boobs and a well rounded rump, with legs that carry her swaying hips with a light footed grace. She looks on the coupled lovers with burning disdain as Venus shakes and cries out in the throes of climax.\n\n"+
            "The narrator elaborates on the development as she arrives. \"Little did Venus know, but Proserpina had also fallen for Adonis. Her jealousy of her rival enraged her and nearly consumed her. She called on Jupiter, father of the gods, to resolve their feud, but he refused to side with either of them. Instead, Jupiter decided that Venus and Proserpina would share Adonis for half the year each.\"\n\n"+
            "At this, Venus and Adonis separate, the goddess' body lightly sheened with sweat as she comes down from her orgasmic high. Meanwhile, Adonis crosses to the opposite end of the wide mattress, where the newly arrived woman, as Proserpina, joins him.\n\n"+
            "Proserpina wastes no time pushing Adonis onto the sheets. She steps over his waist, seizing his still-hard cock and aiming it towards herself. Lowering her hips to mount him, she guides him inside with little hesitation. Settling onto her lower legs, she takes him fully under her weight. With his cock neatly embedded, she leans her hands on his biceps to further pin her intended conquest.\n\n"+
            "She kisses Adonis with fierce urgency, but rides him slowly at first. Pumping her juicy ass smoothly up and down, she works his cock into all her best spots. This time, Adonis is the one gasping for breath as Proserpina's pussy has its way with him. She picks up speed, fucking him harder, the wet slap of their bodies growing louder and louder. Her moans punctuate each bounce as she nears the edge.\n\n"+
            "When she cums, her screams of ecstasy fill the whole gallery.\n\n"+
            "For the final act, Adonis takes Venus and Proserpina each by the hand. Deviating from the mythology, he puts the two of them side by side in doggy-style positions, their still-soaking pussies facing the audience. Stepping behind them, he fucks both, alternating vaginas between short sets of thrusts. Taking both women at the same time, it's not long before he, too, reaches his peak. As he does, he shoots long spurts of cum across both ladies' luscious butts, groaning loudly in deep, guttural satisfaction.\n\n"+
