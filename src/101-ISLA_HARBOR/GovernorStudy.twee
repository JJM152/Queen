:: GovernorStudy
The Governor's study is just exactly how you imagined it would be - simple, but comfortable, much like the man himself. A large picture window hangs in the wall granting a view down upon the harbor and sitting in front of it is a solid oak desk that his Lordship the Governor uses for official purposes.
