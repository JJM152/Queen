:: GiftShop
A woody, antiquated air fills this quaint @@color:gold;'Curio Shop'@@, which is filled to every corner with a menagerie of oddities and needful things. \
The hodgepodge of sundry uncatalogued items is like a thousand stories told all at once, yet all are somehow kept tamed and tidy by the loving \
hand of the proprietor. An array of unusual sounds greets you as well - the ticking of old timepieces, the bells of clockwork curiosities and \
the squawk of a testy blue-gold macaw who perches behind the counter. It is a place of humble wonders, brought here from distant shores, collectively \
inhabiting an eccentric life that surpasses the sum of its parts.
