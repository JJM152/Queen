:: PR_GovernorsMansion
This grandiose white manor house occupies the ranking position at the upper end of the city's affluent district, centered on a \
generous plot. Originally the estate home of a prosperous sugar plantation, it has a weathered, colonial charm.

The grounds are entered through an imposing iron gateway. There, the wide, symmetrical mansion itself rises two stories, its clapboard \
facings dressed by even rows of casement windows with louvered shutters. The hipped roof above is fronted by pedimented gables, \
and two shorter wings project from the building's sides. The central carriage porch is supported by Doric columns enclosing the \
front stoop and second floor balcony.
