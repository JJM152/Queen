:: PR_BottlecorkLane
Twisting among the orphaned spaces between the backs and sides of buildings, this odd passage is neither rightly an alley nor a \
street. Its isolation has attracted a bootleg market of makeshift tents, hand carts and the odd back room business. Here, the smells \
of roasting meats, spilled rum, baked goods and other offerings intermingle with the bilge-salt odor of the nearby harbor.
