:: PR_LevantBackRoom
Old lacquer coats the walls here in purple and black, while the ceiling has been colored in royal blue with painted gold \
stars. A sense of the mystical permeates the space, centered on an arrangement of artifacts on several tables. Armoires \
on each wall contain many more such relics, along with stoppered flasks of unfamiliar liquids. Some of them are acquirable, for a price.
