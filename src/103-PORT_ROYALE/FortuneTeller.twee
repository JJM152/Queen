The interior of this shop is small and dark, with the lights casting deep shadows, possibly by design. From the walls hang various \
tapestries of obvious an exotic nature and of purported mystical significance. In the middle of the main area of the shop is a table \
with a massive 'crystal ball', behind which sits the proprietor and self proclaimed psychic.
