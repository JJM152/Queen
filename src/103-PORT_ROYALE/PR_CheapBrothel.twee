For a place that caters to a lower class crowd, the @@color:gold;'Lusty Lass'@@ is a notch above the rest. The interior is modest, but \
well maintained - the beds are clean, the food is decent and the drinks aren't watered down. The bottom floor of the building consists \
of a small bar and waiting area for clients, while the upstairs hosts a variety of rooms for 'conducting business'.
